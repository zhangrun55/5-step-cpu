WARNING:Pack:2574 - The F7 multiplexer symbol
   "monitor/Mmux_char1_bit[5]_line6[63]_Mux_178_o_11" and its I1 input driver
   "monitor/_n1973<5>1" were implemented suboptimally in the same slice
   component. The function generator could not be placed directly driving the F7
   multiplexer. The design will exhibit suboptimal timing.

WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net
   CPU/Mram_ex_ir[15]_PWR_10_o_Mux_93_o is sourced by a combinatorial pin. This
   is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to control the loading of data
   into the flip-flop.

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
